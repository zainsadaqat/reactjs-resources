# ReactJS Roadmap

## 1. Prerequisites

Before diving into React, ensure you are confident in:

• HTML/CSS: Semantic tags, Flexbox, Grid, etc.
• JavaScript (ES6+):
• Variables (let, const)
• Arrow functions
• Template literals
• Destructuring
• Spread/rest operators
• Promises and async/await
• Modules and imports/exports
• Basic Git/GitHub for version control.

## 2. Core React Concepts

Start with the basics and build your foundation

1. React Basics:
   • What is React and why use it?
   • Components
   • JSX (JavaScript XML)
   • Props and Prop Drilling
   • State and State Management

2. Hooks (Modern React):

• useState, useEffect, useContext
• useRef, useReducer, useCallback, useMemo

3. Component Lifecycle:

• Mounting, Updating, Unmounting

4. Event Handling:
   • onClick, onChange, onSubmit, etc.

5. Conditional Rendering:
   • Ternary operators, short-circuit evaluation, etc.

## 3. Intermediate Topics

1. Forms in React:
   • Controlled and Uncontrolled Components
   • Validation with libraries like Formik or React Hook Form

2. Routing:
   • React Router (v6+)
   • Nested Routes, Protected Routes
   • Lazy Loading with React.Suspense

3. State Management:
   • Context API
   • Redux Toolkit (preferred over legacy Redux)
   • Zustand or Recoil (modern alternatives)

4. Error Handling:
   • Error Boundaries
   • Try/Catch for async operations

## 4. Advanced React Concepts

1. Performance Optimization:
   • React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
   • Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR):
   • Next.js for SSR and Static Site Generation (SSG)

3. TypeScript with React:
   • Props and State with TypeScript
   • Generics and advanced types

4. Testing:
   • Unit Testing with Jest
   • Component Testing with React Testing Library
   • E2E Testing with Cypress or Playwright

5. Animation Libraries:
   • Framer Motion or React Spring

## 5. Ecosystem & Tools

Master these tools and libraries to become an efficient ReactJS developer:

1. Styling:
   • CSS Modules
   • Styled-Components
   • Tailwind CSS

2. State Management:
   • Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Recoil

3. API Calls:
   • Axios or Fetch API
   • SWR or React Query (for caching and data synchronization)

4. Form Libraries:
   • Formik or React Hook Form

5. Next.js:
   • Learn for SSR, SSG, API Routes, and more.

6. Build Tools:
   • Vite (modern alternative to CRA)
   • Webpack (optional, for custom setups)

7. Deployment:
   • Netlify, Vercel, or AWS Amplify

## 6. Soft Skills & Best Practices

1. Best Practices

• Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
• Follow React coding conventions.
• Break down UI into small, reusable components.
• Avoid over-optimization; optimize only when necessary.
• Document your code for better collaboration.

2. Soft Skills

   • Communication: Explain your thought process clearly.
   • Problem-solving: Debugging and finding solutions effectively.
   • Collaboration: Work well with designers, backend developers, and QA teams.

## 7. Building Projects

1. Beginner

- Todo App
- Weather App

2. Intermediate

- Blog Platform
- Ecommerce

3. Advance

- Real Time Chat App
- Dashboard with Data Visualization (D3.js or Chart.js)
- Full-stack App with Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB/PostgreSQL
