# Props and Props Drilling in ReactJS

## Props

### What are Props?

- Props (short for “properties”) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React.
- They are read-only and immutable, meaning the child component cannot modify the data received through props.
- Props are passed as attributes in JSX.

### How Do Props Work?

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Welcome name="John" />;
}
```

In this example:

- The App component passes the name prop to the Welcome component.
- The Welcome component displays “Hello, John!”.

## Prop Drilling

Prop drilling occurs when props are passed through multiple levels of components to reach the desired child component.

```jsx
function GrandChild({ message }) {
  return <h1>{message}</h1>;
}

function Child({ message }) {
  return <GrandChild message={message} />;
}

function Parent() {
  const message = "Hello from Parent!";
  return <Child message={message} />;
}
```

Here:

1. The Parent component has a message state or variable.
2. The message prop is passed from Parent to Child and then to GrandChild.
3. This is prop drilling because the Child component doesn’t need the message but must pass it down to GrandChild.

### Problems with Prop Drilling

1. Unnecessary Props Passing: Intermediate components pass props they don’t use.
2. Reduced Readability: It can be hard to track which components depend on which props.
3. Tightly Coupled Components: Changes to data flow can require updates in multiple components.

### Solutions to Prop Drilling

#### 1. Context API

- Provides a way to share data between components without explicitly passing props through every level.

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext } from "react";

const MessageContext = createContext();

function GrandChild() {
  const message = useContext(MessageContext);
  return <h1>{message}</h1>;
}

function Parent() {
  const message = "Hello from Context!";
  return (
    <MessageContext.Provider value={message}>
      <GrandChild />
    </MessageContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

#### 2. State Management Libraries

- Redux, Zustand, or Recoil: Useful for managing global state across the app.
- These libraries prevent prop drilling by allowing components to directly access the state.

#### Key Takeaways

- Props: Essential for passing data, simple for small applications.
- Prop Drilling: Becomes problematic as the app grows and intermediate components are forced to pass unnecessary data.
- Use Context API or State Management Libraries to simplify data flow and improve maintainability.
