# Functional Components

## What are Functional Components?

Functional components are plain JavaScript functions that return React elements (JSX). They are simpler and more concise compared to class components and are now the most widely used way to create components in React.

## Characteristics of Functional Components

Stateless in the Past: Initially, functional components couldnâ€™t manage state or lifecycle methods, but with the introduction of React Hooks, they can now manage both state and lifecycle functionalities. 2. Simpler Syntax: Functional components are easier to write and understand compared to class components. 3. Performance-Friendly: They are lightweight and often perform better than class components.
